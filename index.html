        <div class="main-bio">
            <p>I’m a former craft brewer turned full-stack developer. I like to build things: I once secretly constructed a stroller without assistance at the age of four, and I’ve been creating and designing things ever since. Whether it’s web applications, beer recipes, or Ikea closet organizers, I’ve always had a knack for putting things together.</p>
            <p>I decided to transfer my brewing skills to the web development industry after experiencing the frustrations of using inefficient brewing software and web applications. Seeking solutions, I developed an ardent interest in computer programming and enrolled in the Full Stack Coding Boot Camp program at UC-Irvine.</p>
            <p>My science and research experience conjoined with the Coding Boot Camp will prepare me for a career as a full-stack developer. I am currently seeking roles in the software and web development fields beginning in early August. </p>
            <p>I spend my free time rewatching The Office, exploring and enjoying the great outdoors, and continuing my quest for the best bibimbap in the area. If you’d like to discuss any topic from brewing sciences, Korean restaurant recommendations, or web development please feel free to contact me at: nickclear22@gmail.com.</p>
